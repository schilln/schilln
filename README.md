# About me
I'm a senior studying **applied math** and completing a concentration in data science and machine learning.

## ACME (Applied and Computational Mathematics Emphasis)
This is the full name of my major along with its handy acronym. It's a blend of **math**, **computer science**, and **statistics**, with the goal of understanding, designing, and implementing optimization algorithms and machine learning.

Please message me (e.g. on LinkedIn, linked on my profile) for access to my ACME repository which contains my work on coding labs and will be updated with additional work from time to time.

In the meantime... check out my personal projects below!

## CAD (computer-aided design)
What do you get when you combine **3D modeling** with **math and programming**? Onshape's *FeatureScript*.<br>
Check out these projects I coded:
- [Icosahedron](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/21fe442c6fdbdcc9cb2b762c/w/619a021ea6ad2afa637303f4/e/aff030f8e2b8273743bfc213) (a 20-sided regular polyhedron with triangle faces)
- [Customizable 3D-printable name plaque](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/08b419c7da1909c559eabade/w/1ad50dfb376ded4ce8ed581e/e/6325e3273e6240fbe1433c1f) (to create your own plaque, create a free account and copy the document, then simply enter your name)
- [Customizable microscope slide drying stand](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/536a36b569d229831fe86d98/w/e6635d88101c4c250cab12e7/e/592906cbd2fa5daeac849e62) (again, use a free account to copy the document and customize)
