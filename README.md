## Modeling and altering the Sun's gravity ([paper](2023_A_Space_ODE-ssey.pdf))

We take for granted Newton's laws of motion and his universal law of gravitation.
To help us learn about ordinary differential equations (in preparation for studying partial differential equations and optimal control), we wondered, What happens if we *change* the law of gravitation?
This paper is the result!
(Along with some other experiments.)

## Analyzing neural net loss surfaces in "dataspace" ([paper and code](https://github.com/schilln/loss-surfaces-in-data))

Traditional deep learning research often examines a model's loss surface in "weightspace"—one measures how the loss changes on a dataset as the parameters, or weights, vary.
Many researchers believe that "flat minimizers" of the loss surface correspond to better generalization, or performance of the model on unseen data.
However, good generalization actually consists of flat minimizers in *dataspace*, not weightspace.
That is, a small variation in data—such as the difference between unseen data and training data—should not lead to a significant decrease in model performance.

To that end, this project makes a first attempt at answering the question, How do loss surfaces in weightspace compare with those in dataspace?
An answer to this question would justify or refute the claim that "flat minimizers" in weightspace correspond to good generalization.

## ACME (Applied and Computational Mathematics Emphasis)
This is the full name of my undergraduate major along with its handy acronym.
It's a blend of **math**, **computer science**, and **statistics**, with the goal of understanding, designing, and implementing optimization algorithms and machine learning.

Please message me (e.g. on LinkedIn, linked on my profile) for access to my ACME repository which contains my work on coding labs and will be updated with additional work from time to time.

## CAD (computer-aided design)
What do you get when you combine **3D modeling** with **math and programming**? Onshape's *FeatureScript*.<br>
Check out these projects I coded:
- [Icosahedron](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/21fe442c6fdbdcc9cb2b762c/w/619a021ea6ad2afa637303f4/e/aff030f8e2b8273743bfc213) (a 20-sided regular polyhedron with triangle faces)
- [Customizable 3D-printable name plaque](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/08b419c7da1909c559eabade/w/1ad50dfb376ded4ce8ed581e/e/6325e3273e6240fbe1433c1f) (to create your own plaque, create a free account and copy the document, then simply enter your name)
- [Customizable microscope slide drying stand](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/536a36b569d229831fe86d98/w/e6635d88101c4c250cab12e7/e/592906cbd2fa5daeac849e62) (again, use a free account to copy the document and customize)
